# Razor View Render

A service which renders views into strings that cant be used in the .net core framework.

This solution shows how the service can be used to rendering emails from views as a string. It also shows how the view can be accessed in different assemblies as an embedded resource, whilst also being used in a web application. Allowing for easy testability.

Code for the rendering service found here https://github.com/aspnet/Entropy/blob/dev/samples/Mvc.RenderViewToString/RazorViewToStringRenderer.cs
